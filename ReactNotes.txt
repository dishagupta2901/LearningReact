React is manipulating Dom using JS. while rendering, it's converted to HTML which the browser understands.

render -> replaces the things inside root instead appending.

npm manages package

in package.json version no has a prefix of ^ (caret) or ~ (tilda). Caret installs minor upgrades automatically whereas tilda installs major upgrades as well.

Bundler used by React :  a tool that takes all your JavaScript code, along with any other assets like CSS or images, and combines them into a single file (or a few files) that can be served to the browser. Eg. Webpack, {others : parcel, rollup, etc)

transitive dependencies : dependencies of our packages dependencies. eg. parcel is our devdependency but it has its own dependencies.

to start host in local host - npx parcel index.html
to build it in localhost - npx parcel index.html -> delete main from package.json
dist folder is packing the code for production ready. - known as production build - highly optimised and compressed.

to make it browser compatibility, add browserslist in package.json -> 
	browserslist: [last 2 chrome versions, last 2 edge versions] or [last 2 versions]
